Introduction

The Licensing page displays all per-device licenses for your Meraki organization. This page is only available for organizations that use the per-device licensing model (as opposed to co-termination licensing).

Each license record shows detailed information including the license type, state, assigned device, and important dates such as activation and expiration.

To view Licenses for All Organizations, from the Licensing page, click Home.

To view Licenses for a specific Organization, from the Licensing page, click the relevant Organization node.

Search, filter, sort, view and download data. For example, filter on State = expired to identify all expired licenses, or filter on Expiration to find licenses expiring soon.
