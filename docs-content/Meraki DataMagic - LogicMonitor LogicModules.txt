 Device Status (All Device Types):
 > 0 - Alerts when any device is not online (values: 1=alerting, 2=offline, 3=dormant)
 

 
 License Expiry (All Device Types):
 
 

 
 WiFi Utilization (Access Points):
 = 100% - Critical alert when 2.4GHz, 5GHz, or 6GHz bands reach full utilization
 

 
 Port Disconnection (Switch Interfaces):
 = 1 - Alert when switch ports become disconnected

 Technical Architecture

 Database Connectivity: All modules connect to a PostgreSQL database populated by the Meraki DataMart system using JDBC with configurable credentials.

 
 Common Properties Required:

 
 meraki_datamagic.username - Database username

 meraki_datamagic.password - Database password

 meraki_datamagic.server - PostgreSQL server address

 meraki_datamagic.database - Database name

 meraki_datamagic.network_id - Meraki Network ID for filtering

 
 
 Collection Method: Most modules use Groovy batch scripts with complex SQL queries to extract metrics from the normalized DataMart schema.

 
 Instance Management: Multi-instance modules automatically discover devices and components, with proper cleanup of inactive instances.
