Introduction

To view the Organizations:

 From the Meraki Estate menu click Organizations to see a read-only view of your organizations data

 Filter, sort and download the Organizations data which your Administrator has added to DataMagic

 You can expand the tree, or you can click other menu items to drill down into the details.

An Organization is the top level of the Meraki hierarchy. You can add as many Organizations as you like to your Tenant via the Admin | Oranizations page. This is useful if you have multiple Meraki accounts or you are a Managed Service Provider.
