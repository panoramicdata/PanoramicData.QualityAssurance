Expressions are the core of NCalc101. An expression is a combination of numbers, operators, variables, and functions that evaluates to a result.

Writing Expressions

 Type your expression in the input box, such as 3 + 4 * 2.

 Use parentheses to control the order of operations: (3 + 4) * 2.

 Expressions can include variables and functions for more advanced calculations.

Supported Operators

 + Addition

 - Subtraction

 * Multiplication

 / Division

 ^ Exponentiation (e.g., 2^3 = 8)

 Parentheses ( ) for grouping

Using Functions

NCalc101 supports many built-in functions. For example:

 sqrt(16) returns 4

 sin(3.14) returns the sine of 3.14 radians

 log(100) returns the natural logarithm of 100

Examples

 5 * (2 + 3) evaluates to 25

 sqrt(9) + 4 evaluates to 7

 2^4 - 6 evaluates to 10

Tips

 Check your expression for typos before evaluating.

 Use the Examples page for more sample expressions.

 Combine variables and functions for powerful calculations.

Mastering expressions is the key to getting the most out of NCalc101!
