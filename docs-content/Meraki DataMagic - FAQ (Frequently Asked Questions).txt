What information is held on Mac Vendors?

MAC vendors are unique identifiers tied to a device's MAC address that tell us about the manufacturer. Using MAC vendors are important when security and troubleshooting your network.

We provide an initial list of MAC vendors but you should ensure that it is up to date. This can be achieved using data available in the public domain. In particular, ensure that the MAC Vendor priority field is set appropriately. If you need further help, submit a Feedback request.

Can we have an on-site version?

Yes. A DataMagic Datacenter version is available for purchase.
