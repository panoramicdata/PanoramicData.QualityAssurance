Variables allow you to store values and reuse them in your expressions. This makes calculations more flexible and your work easier to manage.

Defining Variables

 Type a variable assignment in the input box, such as x = 10.

 Press Enter or click Evaluate to save the variable.

 You can now use x in other expressions, e.g., x * 5 will evaluate to 50.

Using Variables in Expressions

 Simply reference the variable name in your expression: y = x + 3

 Variables can be used with functions: sqrt(x)

 You can update a variable by assigning a new value: x = 20

Variable Naming Rules

 Variable names must start with a letter and can include letters, numbers, and underscores (e.g., total_1).

 Variable names are case-sensitive: total and Total are different.

Examples

 a = 5

 b = a * 2

 result = b + 10

 sqrt(result)

Tips

 Use variables to break complex calculations into smaller, manageable steps.

 Clear or update variables as needed to keep your workspace organized.

 Check the Output and Results page to see the current values of your variables.
